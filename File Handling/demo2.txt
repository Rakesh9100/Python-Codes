Dictionaries: Dictionary is a built-in Python Data Structure that is mutable.
 It is similar in spirit to List, Set, and Tuples\.n However, it is not indexed by a sequence of numbers but indexed based on keys and can be understood as associative arrays.
 On an abstract level, it consists of a key with an associated value.
 In Python, the Dictionary represents the implementation of a hash-table.
It improves the readability of your code.
 Writing out Python dictionary keys along with values adds a layer of documentation to the code.
 If the code is more streamlined, it is a lot easier to debug.
